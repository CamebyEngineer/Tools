"""Mining Sequence Generator. 
    Author: C Saunders
    Created: March 2018

    Purpose
        Simplify the creation of mining sequence generation for the XPAC 
        long term model. 

    Version 
        Verison 1 

    Description
        Requires a list of validation blocks to be exported from XPAC.
        and saved in the script directory as 'mine plan.csv'.
        Delivers output to stdout which needs ot be redirected to a file. 
    
    Requirements
        'mine plan.csv' must be in the format C, Strip, Block>Seam, Pil Number
        Otherwise you'll need to rename the row indexes for the dictionary

    Todo
        * Consider parseing arguements for location of inputs and outputs.
        * Consider comandline access to generator sequence function.
            -> that's a dumb idea. 
        * Consider reformating to if name = '__main__' format.
        * General Code Cleanup / Check if compliant with PEP 8
        * Crap! Need to teach it to count backwards. B68 --> B01
